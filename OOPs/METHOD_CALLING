1️⃣ Method Definition

In Customer.java

public static String getCustomerDetails(int Costid, String Costname, double Costbill)


Here,
Costid, Costname, and Costbill are parameters (sometimes called formal parameters).
They are placeholders — variables that will receive values when the method is called.

2️⃣ Method Call

In Test.java

String Details = Customer.getCustomerDetails(id, name, bill);


Here,
id, name, and bill are arguments (sometimes called actual parameters).
These are the real values you input from the keyboard using the Scanner.

💡 How Java connects them

When you call:

Customer.getCustomerDetails(id, name, bill);


👉 Java copies the values of your arguments (id, name, bill)
into the method’s parameters (Costid, Costname, Costbill).

So it’s like doing this behind the scenes:

In Test.java	In Customer.java (after method call)
id = 101	Costid = 101
name = "Arjun"	Costname = "Arjun"
bill = 5000.75	Costbill = 5000.75

After copying, the method uses its own parameter variables (Costid, Costname, Costbill) inside the method body — they hold the same data, but they’re separate variables.

📦 Analogy

Think of it like passing copies of data:

You (the caller) fill out a form (id, name, bill) and give it to the Customer method.
The method receives its own copy of those values (Costid, Costname, Costbill) to work with.
Changing one doesn’t affect the other.
