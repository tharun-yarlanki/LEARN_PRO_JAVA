In coding tests for top MNCs (like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, Capgemini) and product-based companies (like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Adobe, Oracle), the difficulty level depends on the company type:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Service-based Companies (Infosys, TCS, Accenture, Wipro, etc.)

They usually focus on basic programming and logic-building. 
Expect questions like:

Reverse a string / number

Check palindrome (string/number)

Check prime number

Fibonacci series

Factorial of a number

Armstrong number

Count vowels/consonants in a string

Find largest/smallest element in an array

Sort an array (without using library functions)

Find sum of digits of a number

Swap two numbers without using a third variable

ðŸ‘‰ Here the focus is: loops, arrays, strings, simple math, basic conditions.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Mid-level Product Companies (Adobe, Oracle, Cisco, etc.)

They go one step higher. Expect:

Searching & Sorting algorithms (binary search, bubble sort, selection sort)

String problems (anagram check, remove duplicates, substring search)

Matrix problems (transpose, rotate, diagonal sum)

Recursion-based problems (factorial, Fibonacci, power of a number)

Use of collections (HashMap, HashSet) to count frequencies, find duplicates

Simple object-oriented concepts (class, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)

Basic pattern printing (stars, pyramids, number patterns)

ðŸ‘‰ Here the focus is: data structures + OOP basics.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Top Product Companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.)

Here, tests are DSA-heavy:

Arrays (subarray sum, max/min subarray, two-sum problem)

Strings (longest palindrome substring, substring matching, reversing words)

Linked List (reverse, detect cycle, merge two sorted lists)

Stack/Queue problems (balanced parentheses, next greater element)

Recursion + Backtracking (N-Queens, subsets, permutations)

Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, coin change, longest common subsequence)

Tree problems (inorder traversal, height of tree, lowest common ancestor)

Graph problems (DFS, BFS, shortest path)

ðŸ‘‰ Here the focus is: algorithms, problem-solving, optimization.

âœ… Summary

Service-based â†’ Basic programs (loops, arrays, strings).

Mid-level â†’ Some DS + OOP + collections.

Top product â†’ Full DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).
